# Javascript and classes: 
 - JS is a prototype based language.

# OOP: 
 * Object: 
    - Collection of properties and methods
    - toLowerCase

 * Why use OOP?
    * PARTS OF OOP: 
        - object literal

        - Constructor function
        - Prototypes
        - Classes
        - Instances (new, this)


### PROTOTYPES:   
   The prototype of array is redirected to object. Similarly, the prototype of a string is also redirected to object. 
         ARRAY ---> OBJECT ---> NULL
         STRING ---> OBJECT ---> NULL
      This implies that the properties that are available to object, are also available to string and array, (whether these are usable or not is dependent on them).
   Now what is a function: (Object.js)
         FUNCTION ---> OBJECT ---> NULL   ( it is possible )


# 4 pillars of OOP: 
 - Abstraction
 - Encapsulation
 - Inheritance
 - Polymorphism
